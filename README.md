2020 Senior Project for the Colorado State University - Pueblo Engineering Department 

-Used a Husqvarna Automower as an autonomous robot and attatched sensors to it to read ph and moisture readings in a lawn. A thermal camera was also atttached to take pictures.-

*This code runs the mower to start and stop on a timer then reads the data from the sesnor files and plots them onto an image from the lawn in use*

*User must change their specifc credintials in the automowy file (email, passowrd)*
